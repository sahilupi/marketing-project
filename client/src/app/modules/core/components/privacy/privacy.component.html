      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2><br>
      <div dir="ltr">
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>This privacy policy (the “Policy”) describes the privacy practices of
            Markutting Inc. (“Markutting,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) with respect to our online video advertising services. We
            select, target and deliver our advertisers’ ads through use of our proprietary technology and/or technology
            from third party technology service providers, if any (the “Markutting Platform”). In addition, in order to
            provide our users, current and prospective customers and job seekers, with information regarding our
            services, we maintain our corporate website, </span><u><span><a rel="nofollow"
                href="http://www.Markutting.com/" target="_blank">www.Markutting.com</a> </span></u><span>(the “Site”). This
            Policy describes how we collect, use and disclose information in connection with our operation of the
            Markutting Platform and the Site.</span></div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt">Markutting reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time by posting the
          changes on the Site.</div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt">Your continued use of the Markutting Platform and/or the Site constitutes your
          acceptance of the current posted Policy.</div> <br> <b>What Information We Collect – Personally Identifiable
          Information</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>Markutting does not collect personally identifiable information through
            operation of the Markutting Platform, but does collect personally identifiable information through the
            Site.</span></div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>The personally identifiable information that is collected through the Site
            allows us to identify a potential user as a specific individual. Such personally identifiable information
            includes, but is not limited to your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. The Site
            collects personally identifiable information about users only if a user voluntarily provides that
            information to the Site. Personally identifiable information is collected on the Site in various instances
            including, without limitation: (i) through the “Contact Us” function, which requests a user to provide his,
            her or its name, address, email address and telephone number, as well as some additional basic information
            regarding the project that requires our services, (ii) a user posts a comment in the blog section of the
            Site, and submits his or her name and email address in connection with the posting or (iii) a user
            subscribes to the Site’s subscription function to obtain content updates by providing his or her email
            address.</span></div> <br> <b>What Information We Collect – Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b> <br>
        <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>The Markutting Platform collects non-personally identifiable information
            regarding how many times a video or other content is requested by users, what content is viewed, the dates
            and times of the requests, and how the video or other content is interacted with by the user. In addition,
            IP addresses are collected in order to determine the approximate geographic location of users so that we can
            serve advertisements that are more relevant to that location.</span></div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>The Site collects non-personally identifiable information that your browser
            automatically sends whenever you visit the Site, including information about your web request, click stream
            information, IP address, browser type, browser language, date and time of the request.</span></div> <br>
        <b>Cookies and Beacons</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>We, and some of our third-party service providers, collect non-personally
            identifiable information through the use of “cookies.” A cookie is a small text file containing a string of
            characters that is placed by an Internet server on your hard drive. A session ID cookie expires when you
            close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use
            persistent cookies to store the non-personally identifiable described above, and to store inferences we make
            based on that non-personally identifiable information about what a User’s interests might be. Most web
            browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can change your web browser settings to cause your
            browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can remove and/or disable cookies
            by following directions provided in your Internet web browser’s “help” file or menu. Please be aware,
            however, that some aspects of the Markutting Platform may not function properly if cookies are
            disabled.</span></div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>We also collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of
            “tracking pixels,” also known as “beacons.” A tracking pixel is a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel
            x 1 pixel) that is placed on a web page and, in combination with a cookie, allows for the collection of
            information regarding the use of the web page that contains the tracking pixel. We use tracking pixels to
            tell when an advertisement has been clicked on or otherwise interacted with, and use that information to
            judge which advertisements are more appealing to users. In some cases, we use third party service providers
            to help us collect and analyze this information.</span></div> <br> <b>Third-Party Information</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>We also receive non-personally identifiable information regarding user
            demographics and preferences from third-parties who collect and make available such non-personally
            identifiable information for advertisement-serving purposes. Because we cannot control the activities of
            third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for your use of their services or for any use of your
            personal information by such third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy
            and security practices as ourselves.</span></div> <br> <b>How We Use Information</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>We use non-personally identifiable information for purposes of displaying
            advertisements to users that are more likely to be relevant to them than what we would be able to display
            without the use of such information. If requested by an advertiser, we may also use non-personally
            identifiable information to determine whether to serve an advertisement to a user and which advertisement to
            serve. We also use non-personally identifiable information to analyze usage of and improve our advertising
            services. In some cases, we use third-party service providers to assist us with such analysis. Please note
            that the non-personally identifiable information we know relates only to the IP address and the recent
            activity of the web browser software, to the extent that cookies are enabled in that software.</span></div>
        <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>Markutting does not share the personally-identifiable information that you
            provide to Site with any third party, other than with its service providers that help Markutting provide the
            services that you request.</span></div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>Markutting may transfer the information it collects on the Markutting Platform
            and the Site to any successor in interest to Markutting (such as a company that acquires Markutting), or
            internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent). Markutting may also disclose
            personally identifiable information about a user if it determines that an applicable law, regulation or
            legal process requires it, or if Markutting determines that it needs to share such information to protect or
            enforce Markutting’s rights or the rights of another user.</span></div> <br> <b>What We Disclose and Who We
          Disclose it To</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>The non-personally identifiable information we collect and receive is
            provided to third-party service providers that assist us in running our business operations. These include,
            but are not limited to, data storage providers and processing facilities. We also provide non-personally
            identifiable information to our network of publishers, advertisers and other third parties in order to
            report the performance of advertisements displayed through use of our services.</span></div> <br>
        <b>Security</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>Markutting uses commercially reasonable security measures that are designed to
            protect the security, integrity and privacy of the personally identifiable information. Please note,
            however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Therefore, while we
            strive to protect your information, please be advised that Markutting assumes no responsibility or liability
            for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other
            causes beyond our reasonable control.</span></div> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>Markutting’s products, services and websites are directed to, and intended for
            use by, adults only. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the
            age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information
            from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records.</span></div> <br>
        <b>Updates to this Policy</b> <br> <br>
        <div style="line-height:20pt"><span>We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the
            effective date at the beginning of the Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay
            informed about how we collect, use and disclose information.</span></div> <br> <b>Facebook Data Deletion</b>
